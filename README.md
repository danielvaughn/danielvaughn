## Daniel Vaughn

This is my personal repository of Javascript functions that I tend to re-use between projects,
and have no qualms about releasing publicly.

Every individual function is released as an independent script.
This is to prevent applications from accidentally installing all my code (which they are highly unlikely to want).

### [Use Flow](https://github.com/danielvaughn/danielvaughn/tree/main/react/useFlow)
I wrote this custom hook alongside a former colleague of mine, and have since added and modified it to account for a variety of use cases.
